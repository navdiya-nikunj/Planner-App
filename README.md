## Weather Widget Documentation


The Weather Widget is a valuable addition to the Planner App, providing users with real-time weather information. This widget displays the weather description, temperature, sunrise and sunset times, and wind speed. The data is obtained by making requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for locations worldwide.

## Why Choose the Weather Widget

The Weather Widget offers several benefits that enhance the functionality and user experience of the Planner App:

1. Relevance: Weather conditions greatly influence daily planning. By incorporating the Weather Widget, users can easily access current weather information and make informed decisions based on the forecast.

2. Versatility: The Weather Widget caters to a wide range of users, including those who require weather updates for personal, professional, or recreational purposes. It provides essential information for various scenarios such as travel planning, outdoor activities, or dressing appropriately for the day.

3. Seamless Integration: The Weather Widget seamlessly integrates into the existing Planner App interface, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience. Users can add the widget to their personalized planner pages and effortlessly access weather details.

## Working of the Weather Widget

The Weather Widget fetches weather data by leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API. The API allows us to retrieve weather information based on the user's selected location. Here is a step-by-step overview of how the Weather Widget operates:

1. Location Selection: The location is determined by the browser's geolocation capabilities to automatically determine the user's current position.

2. API Request: Once the location is determined, the Weather Widget sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, providing the chosen location as a parameter.

3. API Response: The API responds with a JSON object containing various weather-related data points, including the weather description, temperature, sunrise and sunset times, and wind speed.

4. Data Display: The Weather Widget extracts the relevant information from the API response and displays it on the Planner App interface. The weather description provides a summary of the current conditions, while the temperature is shown in the user's preferred unit (e.g., Celsius). Additionally, the sunrise and sunset times (in Your Local Timezone) help users plan their day accordingly, and the wind speed information gives insights into the current wind conditions.

5. Real-Time Updates: The Weather Widget periodically refreshes the displayed weather information to ensure the data remains accurate and up-to-date. The refresh interval can be configured to suit the application's requirements and user preferences.
